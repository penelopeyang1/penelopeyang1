✨ The world doesn’t need more software engineers - it needs creators with vision.  
I’m Penelope, and I build digital experiences that are equal parts useful, beautiful, and unforgettable.

🧩 I mix logic with aesthetics  
🎮 I make interfaces interactive, playful, and bold  
🧠 Full-stack 
🤖 Curious about AI, obsessed with usability  
🔧 Always exploring new ideas and building with intention

I’m not trying to reinvent the wheel - just make the ride a little smoother.
